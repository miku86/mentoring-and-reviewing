```
I just signed up for the Data Analyst Nanodegree.
It looks like this is going to require a pretty big time commitment,
and I’m not sure that I’ll have enough time to put into getting everything done.
But I really want tocomplete this program. What should I do?
```

- [ ] You shouldn’t really need all that much time to study. You’ll probably be fine.
- [x] Hi User12345! I’m a Forum Mentor for Udacity, and I can certainly help
      you out here. Can you tell me how much time you do have each week
      to work on your Nanodegree program?
- [ ] If you’re not going to be able to commit the time you’ll need to, this
      program probably isn’t for you. Maybe try a Nanodegree program that
      has a smaller time commitment.

# Investigate the Situation

## Reflect

A student writes you a message, saying:

```
I'm not sure why my programming code isn't working.
I think I've done everything right, and I don't understand what's going on.
Can you help me?
```

What are some questions you might ask to get a better understanding of this student's issue?

### Things to think about

A good response might include one or more general open ended questions like: “What should your code be doing?” or “What happens when you try to run your code?” Even answers that are more general can be valid: “What kind of code are you working on?” Even if you don't understand yourself how to fix the issue, there's a good chance you might be able to point the student in the right direction.

## Reflect

A student starts off a conversation with you like so:

```
I don't know how to start this problem. I feel lost.
```

What might you say to them to help them get started?

### Things to think about

Keep in mind that rather than telling the student exactly how to solve the problem, we want to guide them and nudge them in the right direction. Often just getting a student talking about the question at hand will open them up to thinking independently and help something click. Here are a few examples of helpful responses:

"I'm sorry that this problem feels a little overwhelming! It's often helpful to start approaching tricky questions by thinking about what information you already have that might be relevant. What do we already know that could be helpful?

Let's figure it out together! Is there something in particular about the problem that feels difficult?

We will definitely get to the bottom of this :) What have you thought about so far? Do parts of this problem remind you of any others you've encountered before?"

A student writes:

```
I feel like I'm never going to finish this Nanodegree program.
Everything just feels like it takes so long to complete.
```

### Things to think about

Some possible answers:

“I’m sorry to hear you’re getting frustrated. What’s challenging you right now?”

“Nanodegree programs can be challenging. I might be able to help you. Why do you think you won’t be able to finish?”

The important thing to remember is that the best course of action is to start asking questions first, before moving on to a solution.

# Guide the Student

Once you’ve identified the root of a student’s issue or concern, it’s time to do dig in and guide the student toward a solution. Remember, the key here is to guide them, not provide the solution. Students experience the most impactful, longest lasting learning when their brains work to discover solutions and the strategies for getting there. As they mentally exert themselves through challenges, they build the problem solving frameworks in their heads that they'll need to work independently on even tougher tasks in the future.

## Reflect

There's not just one right way to guide a student through tackling a problem. Depending on the situation, you may want to use any number of techniques to help them on a path to a solution. Which of the following techniques do you think could help you guide students appropriately in different situations?

- [x] Link back to course videos to remind the student of information they may have forgotten that will help them solve the problem
- [x] Ask them questions that will lead them in the right direction
- [x] Link to documentation, forum posts, or other credible, relevant resources that will help them understand concepts, syntax, or other necessary information
- [x] Create examples and analogies to illustrate concepts that will help them with the problem they're facing
- [ ] Writing the answer for them
- [ ] tellng them exactly what to do step by step
- [ ] Wishing them good luck on their joruney and leave them figuring it out all on their own

## Reflect

As we've discussed, connecting learners with resources can both contribute to resolving the issue at hand and give them tools and frameworks to use independently when they encounter challenges later on. Think about a few situations you've encountered in your own work when you felt stuck, unsure of how to proceed. What resources did you take advantage of? Take a moment to make a list of at least four key, accessible resources that can serve as go-to places for students learning about your subject matter. These can be code libraries, documentation websites, blogs, meetup groups, online communities, forums, tech talks, or something else!

## Providing Feedback

As you guide students, you will frequently need to provide feedback on their work to help steer them in the right direction. Whether you're looking at an entire program they've written or simply need to let them know that they've made a little mistake in their approach to a problem, it's important to keep a few key ideas in mind:

- Find the good in the work they've done. Point out the ways in which they're already on the right track, like their perseverance in working to understand concepts deeply, their use of resources to problem solve independently, or something else that you would like to encourage them to keep doing in the future. This will reinforce the helpful habits they're building and give them a confidence boost!

- Be open and honest about what you think they can improve. As corny as it sounds, each piece of feedback a person receives is a gift - it's an opportunity for them to learn and grow! Feedback from you and other mentors plays a crucial role in our students building the expertise they need to succeed in the future.

- Maintain a growth mindset about each learner, and encourage students to do so as well. As discussion in the previous lesson, many students struggle with mindset issues. If you demonstrate that you believe in their ability to learn new things and work through challenges, this belief will rub off on them. This will make them feel more comfortable taking learning risks (e.g. working more independently) and making mistakes.

A student with whom you're working on a problem sends you the following message:

```
Okay, so now I need to add 3 and 5 together. 3 + 5 = 10,
so that means that the total cost we're looking for is $10.
```

How would you respond to this student?

- [x] You're so close to the solution! I love that you're keeping mind the bigger picture of what we're trying to solve for as you work through each calculation. Let's back up and check out how you added up the total cost. Could you walk me through what you did?

- [ ] Nice job!! It's great to see how you're guiding yourself through the steps of
      the problem and keeping in mind the bigger picture of what we're trying to solve for.

- [ ] That is not correct. You added 3 and 5 together wrong. Try it again.

- [ ] You don't even know how to add? What is wrong with you? You are bad at
      math. I don't think you're ever going to get this right.

# Close the Interaction

## Reflect

What are some things that you might want to mention to the student at the
close of an interaction?

### Things to think about

You’ll want to summarize what was accomplished in the interaction so that the
student recognizes that a signi cant amount of learning occurred.
That there is additional help available. Provide links to the forums and slack
channels and remind them that 1x1 help is also available if they need it.
