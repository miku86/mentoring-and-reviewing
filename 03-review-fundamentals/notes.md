# Intro

Project reviewers play a crucial role in students' learning process by providing them with personalized feedback on their work. Projects are what make up students’ portfolios - they give students the chance to showcase what they’re capable of producing, and they play a critical role in the hiring process.

When a student successfully completes a project, they show that they’ve mastered the learning concepts associated with that project. Reviewers help students reach this stage by letting them know what they've done well and what they can still improve in their projects. The feedback that project reviewers provide helps students expand their knowledge and hone their skills so they can get to the next stage of their careers.

## Reflect

Think of a time when you received feedback on a project you did (it could be anything - a chair you built, a report you completed at work, your performance at a piano recital, a birthday cake you baked, a presentation you did at a conference, etc.). How did that feedback influence your growth? How did the delivery of the feedback (the way the feedback giver spoke or wrote) impact how you felt afterward? Did you feel more or less motivated to keep improving your craft?

### Things to think about

Thanks for documenting your experience! Feedback on what we produce can majorly shape our learning. The way feedback is delivered, however, can determine whether or not the recipient learns from the situation, acts on any suggestions made, and moves forward with confidence and a healthy growth mindset. Later on in this course, we will discuss how to make all of this happen through the project reviews you produce.

# The Role of Projects

Projects are a student’s chance to bring together everything they’ve learned and apply it in a relevant, realistic context. To complete a project, a student's work must meet particular specifications. Project reviewers give students feedback on their work according to these specifications. You'll let students know what they’ve done well and where they can still improve.

A student can submit each project as many times as he or she needs to. We believe firmly that it’s never a question of whether or not a student’s project can meet specifications, but that all students — given time and support — are capable of meeting specifications on any given project. This iterative process also mirrors how work happens in industry, helping students understand the perspective people within companies have as they launch new products.

## Reflect

Think back to what you learned about growth mindset. How do our policies concerning project submission support students’ development of a growth mindset?

### Things to think about

Allowing students to continue submitting each project until they meet specifications underscores the idea that with hard work, guidance, and resources, anyone can learn anything. This setup also encourages students to see feedback as a gift that will help them conquer tough challenges and expand their knowledge and skills.

# Writing Comments

There are three main places within a single review where you'll communicate with students:

- A note of congratulations or encouragement to the student that reflects on their project submission as a whole. This note is easy to write and goes a long way in making students feel at home at Udacity and receptive to the feedback you've provided. It lets them know that there is a real person (you!) on the other side of this review who wants to help them keep learning and reach their goals.

- Comments about each rubric criteria. These explain at a high level why you have marked their work as meeting specifications for this criteria or not.

- Comments within their project itself. You'll provide in-line commentary within their code, written work, or other final product about what is awesome, what requires changes, and what other changes you would suggest. This detailed feedback should reflect on a more micro level their evaluation for each rubric criteria.

## Reflect

Why do you think that providing detailed, in-line feedback on a student's work is important? How might this impact their mindset and their understanding of the material?

### Things to think about

In-line commentary makes the high-level feedback a student sees in their rubric more concrete. It helps them understand how to translate your big picture remarks into action. We'll talk more soon about best practices for how to write these comments so that they effectively guide students without prescribing exact changes to their work.

## Reflect

What kind of impact do you think the personalized note a student receives in their review can have on their learning experience? How might it change their reaction to the feedback they read?

### Things to think about

The personalized note you'll write to each student whose project you review helps them feel a sense of personal connection to Udacity. It's your chance to show that as part of their Nanodegree program, their project was considered thoroughly and thoughtfully. This note also has the power to help them shift their mindset with regard to the feedback they received. If their project was evaluated as "Requires Changes," we need to motivate them to move forward in a solution-focused way, absorb the feedback they received in their review, and dive right back into iterating on their work. A discouraged, unconfident student will feel less motivated to eventually complete their project. We want to make sure they have confidence they can keep learning and improving their work, feel excited about the challenge they're tackling, develop a sense of ownership over their creative process, and understand that everyone at Udacity is rooting for them to achieve their goals.

## More on In-Line Commentary

An in-line comment, also known as an annotation, will always be categorized as one of three types:

- Required Change: Write these comments to highlight any part of a student’s project that does not meet the rubric’s specifications. These comments play an important role in helping the student grow and learn by concretely rooting the overarching feedback of the rubric in their work itself. This will give them a firm picture of what they need to change. You must include a required change comment for every spot in a student’s project that does not meet the rubric’s specifications.

- Suggested Change: Suggested change comments should be used for parts of a student’s work that meet specifications but that you think could benefit from being tweaked or approached in a different way. When suggesting changes that are not required, keep in mind the student’s current skill level and the level this project and this Nanodegree program are aiming to bringing them to. We want to push students to keep learning and growing without completely and totally overwhelming them.

- Awesome: Use awesome comments to highlight excellent parts of a student’s project. What have they done really well? What is creative and special? What shows that they’ve attained a deep understanding of the concepts underlying the project? Where have they gone above and beyond? Note: There’s no need to restrict “awesome” comments to just parts of a student’s project that completely, completely knock your socks off. The goal of each project and each review is to help the student reach of a higher level of mastery of the content. Your positive feedback through awesome comments will help reinforce good habits they’ve demonstrated and build up their confidence. Awesome comments also play a big role in supporting students’ development of a growth mindset.
