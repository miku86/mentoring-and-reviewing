# About Pedagogy

## Reflect

You may have noticed that many Udacity courses and projects call on students to try to solve types of problems they have never seen before or apply their skills in knowledge in novel ways.

For example, if you know that 3 + 2 = 5 and 17 - 1 = 16, we might ask you to find 25 - 3 + 10.

Why do you think we challenge learners through questions like these? This may, in fact, be one of those questions!

- To engage their brains more actively in the learning process
- To help them become more comfortable with confronting challenges
- To help solidify their understanding of the concepts underlying what they've learned

## Reflect

Consider an area in which you've really deepened your learning in the past two years - maybe you began speaking some French, started playing the tuba, became more proficient at coding, figured out new tactics for mediating conflict, or something else!

What learning strategies do you think had the greatest impact on your retention of material?
What did you do or experience as a learner that really helped new things you learned stick in your brain long-term?

### Things to think about

We're excited to learn about what you feel worked for you! Research shows that activities that engage the learner's brain more intensely help new information stick better. Putting new skills and knowledge into practice by helping others with what you've just learned, taking quizzes, or doing projects can really solidify them them.

Talking on a more meta level about what you've learned can help you situate it within your web of prior knowledge. If you're starting to learn about dolphins but already know a lot about dolphins, whales, dogs, and fish, you'll develop a clearer understanding of what traits they have and and don't have by comparing them to these other animals.

How have you benefited from being challenged in a learning situation?

### Things to think about

It might sound cliche, but your brain responds to exercise the same way your muscles do. It's important for learning to be somewhat challenging, and that's a difficult balance to achieve.

**To learn effectively, students must be actively engaged.**

That's why we keep our videos short and our assessments frequent! It’s also why we often ask students to tackle kinds of problems they’ve never encountered before and discover their own ways to solve them.

Effortful retrieval and application of information strengthens the brain’s connections to that knowledge, making it easier to recall it later on when it is needed. That means it's a good thing when a student has to work hard to solve a problem!

We don’t want students to just have surface-level understanding of content; we want them to develop knowledge on a conceptual level and to be able to apply their skills fluidly. Giving students the chance to try out new things on their own primes their brains to retain their understanding of how and why they approached problems as they did, leading to deeper knowledge that they'll retain for a long time.

When mentoring, your role is to guide a student through solving problems on their own, not to give them the answer. Remember, your goal isn’t just to get them unstuck in the moment they come to you for help - it’s to support them in a way that will set them up for future success.

## Reflect

Which of the following mentoring strategies do you think would improve students' understanding and retention of material?

- Ask students questions to stimulate their thinking
- Use questions about specific problems as vehicles for discussing larger concepts
- Help them connect new things they're learning with the rest of their web of knowledge
- Work with them to create examples and analogies that illustrate concepts
- Guide them in breaking down complex questions into manageable pieces while still
  keeping in mind the bigger picture of the problem they're solving
- Check in with the student periodically during problem solving to zoom out and make sure they understand what they're doing and why
- Ask the student to teach you what they have learned

## Consider

When students want to solidify what they've learned, they often default to rereading text or rewatching videos. Studies show, however, that these techniques are much less effective for longterm retention than quizzing is. Given what you have learned about how learning works, why do you think that this is the case?

### Things to think about

When a student rereads text or rewatches a video that they already have experience with, their sense of familiarity with the material gives them the illusion that they understand it deeply. Thinking critically and responding to questions about the material may make the student feel less certain of their understanding because it poses more of a challenge, but these techniques
strengthen the connections made in the brain to their new knowledge, which will lead to quicker recall of it in the future (and thus better retention long-term).

# The Importance of Mindset

## Reflect

Which of the following statements represent a Growth Mindset over a Fixed
Mindset?

- [ ] I’m no good at programming. I just can’t seem to understand how all
      the pieces fit together.
- [x] At first I couldn’t understand how the code worked, but I was able to
      think about the steps in the function, and I nally gured it out.
- [x] Wow, this looks very complex. I’ll probably need to spend some time
      trying things out before I know how to use it.
- [ ] That student is never going to be able to nish this project. They’ve
      already submitted it four times!

## Want to learn about mindset?

The concept of the growth mindset plays a fundamental role in how we enable
students to succeed. If you'd like to learn even more about growth and fixed mindsets, we highly recommend checking out the book Mindset by Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford whose work has fundamentally shaped our understanding of motivation and success. Check it out and share your thoughts!

## Responding to a Forum Post

Read the following post from the Udacity forum:

```
I have spent close to 5 hours a day for the past two weeks,
yet I am simply unable to write this Python program.
I am trying to make it different than what was already presented to us,
but how are we supposed to do that?
If a program works then why try to rewrite it?
Any alterations just seem to make the program nonfunctional.
I really didn't expect this to be so difficult at this stage.
Maybe programming is just outside my realm of understanding.
I have to admit, I feel very, very frustrated.
I have also realized that I have no future in coding.
I am running out of time to complete this project,
and if I can't do it by the deadline, I am quitting.
```

Given what you've learned about growth mindset, how would you respond to
this student's post?

```
Hey [name],

I can understand your feelings.
Every champion once struggled on his/her way.
But also every champion keeps up going his/her way.

Let's create this thing together.
Do you have an idea, what we can do first?
```

### Things to think about

Teaching students doesn't always mean imparting knowledge. Sometimes it
means working with students to overcome their frustrations and blockers.

# Tone and Respect

## Reflect

Why do you think it’s important to maintain a professional, respectful tone
with students in every interaction?

### Things to think about

The role of the Mentor is to promote student success! By being encouraging,
compassionate and respectful, we can create a positive environment that
makes it easy for our students to succeed in reaching their learning goals.

---

## Practicing Kindness

Remaining empathic and compassionate about students' situations makes them feel
supported and helps them stay open to tackling challenges. Even if a student feels
frustrated or cranky, it is crucial that you remain both understanding and
professional. Remember that their negativity has most likely not been caused by you - learning is hard, and feeling stuck or lost can exasperate even the most positive person or the most seasoned professional. Show that you're listening, that you appreciate their feedback, that you are here to help, and that you believe the two of you together can make things better.

## Helping Harry

A student named Harry sends you the following message. How might you respond to him?

```
I'm so sick of these broken quizzes and this stupid project.
This stuff doesn't even matter for getting a job anyway.
How do I cancel?
```

### Things to think about

To address Harry's frustration, you could say something like this:

```
I am so sorry that you’re feeling frustrated, Harry!
Could you tell me more about the issues you’ve run into with quizzes and the project?
As a mentor, I care a ton about student learning,
and I would love to share your feedback with Udacity,
so they can keep improving your experience.
```

This response expresses the mentor's care and concern about how the student is feeling. We also need to find out more about the issues Harry has run into with the quizzes and the project to get to the root of the matter. It's possible that if you help Harry through what is causing his frustration, he will no longer want to cancel.
