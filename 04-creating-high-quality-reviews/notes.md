# Elemnents of Reviews

A student's project submissions represent critical junctures that guide their growth and in uence their mindset. We think about three main buckets of criteria for creating high quality reviews:

- Communication - The way you express yourself in written form to students
  determines whether or not you relay your thoughts and feedback effectively.
  Excellent communication in reviews can help students develop a growth mindset,
  feel more receptive to feedback, and clearly understand your message.

- Pedagogy - Understanding how to actively engage students in their learning
  process and take their understanding to deeper levels will help them encode and
  retain information longterm. Implementation of pedagogical best practices will
  take your review from being just words on a webpage to being a powerful,
  illuminating learning experience that guides students' growth and development.

- Accuracy - Last but not least, technical correctness within your project review is necessary for fair evaluation of students according to our rubric standards and
  truly informative instruction.

# Communication

All of your interaction with a student in a project review happens through asynchronous writing. Thus the way you communicate is of the utmost importance. As a reminder, each review you do comprises three types of communication:

- Rubric criteria comments
- In-line comments/annotations
- A personal note to the student

Although each of these message types occupies a unique function within the review as a whole, the same core values underlie executing all of them successfully: kindness, honesty, clarity, respect, and personalization. Let's discuss each of them and start practicing how to bring them to life in your project reviews.

## Kindness

Your goal is to help students’ projects become the best work they can be but also to help students stay motivated and engaged with their overall learning process. Make sure to communicate with kindness and focus on empowering the student to keep learning. In every comment you make, consider the following:

- What good elements you can recognize in the student's work?
- How can you phrase critical comments with sensitivity and compassion?
- What language can you use to sound approachable, warm, and enthusiastic about the student's learning?
- How can you encourage them? How might you normalize any struggles they seem to be having and communicate that you have confidence they can make the changes necessary to have their project meet specifications?

Keep in mind that you're evaluating the student's project, not the student themselves. Writing about their work rather than about them can help make it clear that critical feedback is not meant as a character judgment or a personal attack.

## Honesty

Remember that feedback is a gift. Students need to hear from you honestly about what is great in their work and what they still need to adjust. Keep in mind the end goal we’re trying to get them to - meaningful career growth. Our programs require rigorous work and a high level of mastery for graduation because they need to have solid practice to operate well in the real world. Withholding critical feedback about changes they need to make does a disservice to them by keeping them in the dark about how they can continue learning.

## Clarity

The student needs to understand your comments! Write in a way that will clearly communicate the message you need to send. Consider the following:

- Have you provided enough context and detail to the student for your comments to make sense? Will they know which specific part of their project you are writing about?

- Have you used accessible vocabulary that will be understandable to those who may not be communicating in their first language?

- Will your writing make sense to them given their current level of expertise with the content?

## Respect

Respecting students’ boundaries is of the utmost importance for maintaining a safe, productive, positive learning environment. Remember our Community Guidelines, which are part of the Honor Code:

I will help cultivate a positive, supportive learning environment. I will communicate respectfully and considerately with all other Nanodegree participants, Udacity Coaches, and Udacity representatives. I will not share any content that is obscene, illicit, threatening, or discriminatory. I will contribute constructively to discussions with fellow students. I will notify a Udacity Coach immediately if I become aware of cheating or plagiarism by any Nanodegree student.

## Personalization

Each review you complete plays a critical role in a student’s learning and development process. Make sure that every comment you write is catered to the specific student you’re working with. This will show them that you reviewed their project thoroughly and feel invested in their learning. Personalize each comment you add to make sure it’s relevant to their work. What is awesome about their project in particular? What is their current skill level? How can you root your comments in the specific project they've produced?

Even though you won’t know the identity of the student for whom you’re crafting a review, picture a real person (maybe a friend or colleague of yours) as the recipient. How can you make the review you’re writing speak to them and feel like a special, helpful part of their learning process?

---

# Pedagogy

In your role as a project reviewer, your goal is to guide each student to become a stronger problem solver, critical thinker, and independent learner so they can further develop their career in meaningful ways. To make this happen, you will:

- Engage the student actively in their learning experience
- Help the student reach a deep, conceptual understanding of relevant content
- Encourage the student to develop a growth mindset

These core pedagogical strategies will help you transform your reviews into meaningful opportunities for growth that motivate and propel your students through their learning experience.

## Reflect

Let's say you are a reviewer for the Sandwich Recipe Project. Which of the following goals should you keep in mind as you review each student submission for this project? Choose as many as you'd like.

- [x] Helping the student's next iteration of their project meet the rubric's specifications
- [x] Helping the student build the knowledge and skills they will need to create high quality, easy to use recipes on their own in the future
- [x] Preparing the student for a career in cookbook writing
- [x] Guiding the student to a deep understanding of how cooks utilize recipes and thus what best practices result in high quality recipes
- [ ] Telling the student directly what changes they need to make to their projects so that it will meet specifications

## Bloom's Taxonomy: Levels of Knowledge

We have huge goals to achieve through our Nanodegree programs - our content and services need to be able to take students from beginner-level to job-ready. We could not make this happen without our project reviewers! Projects are a student's chance to bring together everything they've learned and create something that has meaning in the field they're trying to enter. To help them get there, we need to help them develop deep, deep knowledge that they can use independently.

Bloom's Taxonomy is a theoretical framework for conceptualizing levels of knowledge that a learner can reach with regard to a particular area. Spend a minute or two examining the following illustration.

[Diagram](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Blooms-Taxonomy-650x366.jpg)

The levels in Bloom's Taxonomy build on one another, so it's our job to walk students up the learning mountain from first just being able to remember basic concepts all the way to being able to use these concepts to create entirely unique and original works (like their projects!). Climbing through the levels of this pyramid does, as you know, take time, effort, and support. We don't expect you to become a complete expert on Bloom's Taxonomy, but it's important to grasp how the way you write your reviews can impact what level of knowledge students attain.

## Reflect

Note the criteria, "The instructions are clear, accurate, and detailed." in the project rubric and its corresponding "Meets Specifications" description. Which of the following in-line comments do you think would best propel the student toward improving in this area and follow Udacity's pedagogical principles?

- [x] Required: How would you like the cook to roll out the dough? For example, what should the dough look like at the end of this step? What equipment should they use to do this? Consider what the dough is like before and after this step to sanity check whether or not your instructions guide the cook in appropriately transforming it. You've gotten off to a good start with what you've included, but more detail here regarding the technique for how to roll out the dough will help ensure that the cook can create the intended final product.

- [ ] Required: I don't know how to roll out pizza dough.
- [ ] Required: These instructions are not suffcient for the reader to know what
      you want them to do with the dough.
- [ ] Required: This instruction violates the rubric's specifications. You need to
      describe exactly how the cook should roll out the dough. Here is a list of
      instructions you can follow to describe how to do that.

## Making the Student an Active Learner

We learn most meaningfully when we go through cognitive processes that challenge us and build on what we already understand. This allows our brains to make strong neural connections and expand our knowledge networks. As explored in the previous quiz, sometimes techniques that might most quickly and directly help a student resolve an issue within their project may not effectively contribute to their learning process. Handing a student solutions or prescribing exact changes for them to make in their project does not help them learn. Because of their written and asynchronous nature, project reviews may feel like difficult places to guide a student without feeding them direct suggestions. Still, there are many ways we can provide students with useful, actionable feedback that will take them deeper in their learning.

## Reflect

In a project review, how might you guide students in the right direction without telling them exactly what changes to make to their work? List out at least 3 ideas for techniques you can use.

### Things to think about

Here are some ideas we have. Are any of them the same as yours? Maybe some new ones for you to add to your repertoire? Did you come up with some amazing ideas that we should know about? Share them with your mentor community when you join them in Slack!

- Ask questions to get them thinking about things to reconsider. (This is a super important technique! Consider using it in combination with any of the ideas below.)
- Provide toy examples that model concepts or skills they need to review.
- Come up with analogies to help them understand difficult concepts.
- Point out test cases that show that their current work does not produce the solution they're looking for. Help them hone in on the specific area of concern, and ask them how they think they might resolve it. Feel free to give a hint if it's extra tricky!
- Link them to Udacity course material that they need to review, with some explanation about which parts to pay closest attention to.
- Send them resources from outside Udacity that will help them understand tricky things. (Make sure these resources do not just show the student the solution! Put on your thinking cap and consider whether each link you send a student will provide them with a great learning experience based on what you've learned through your mentorship courses.)
- Create diagrams or images that illustrate tricky concepts or otherwise help them deepen their understanding.

## Encouraging a Growth Mindset

Helping students develop a growth mindset about their ability to learn will help them succeed in their Nanodegree programs and far beyond (learning never stops!). Project reviews are an excellent opportunity to encourage students to believe in their own ability to grow their knowledge and skills, whether their work requires changes or meets our specifications.

The first step to helping a student develop a growth mindset is to never communicate fixed mindset messages to them. You do not necessarily need to fill every part of your review with flowery, motivational language about how the student has limitless potential for growth. still, including this tactfully in certain areas and completely avoiding fixed mindset language can effectively help shift their perspective.

## Reflect

Which of the following statements might push a student more toward having a fixed mindset? Please select all that apply. (Remember, this is what you would **not** want to say to them!)

- [ ] I would recommend reconsidering whether or not becoming a data scientist is right for you. Based on your work in this project, it seems like pursuing other career paths might make you happier and boost your chances of success.

- [x] You do not meet specifications for five rubric items. You require changes because you do not have a deep enough understanding of statistics.

- [x] Your project needs a lot of work. I feel unsure as to whether or not you're a good fit for this program.

- [x] It looks like you may be one of those people who is bad at math. Don't worry - I have a lot of friends who are like that, too, and they've still managed to have great careers, just not in this area.

- [x] This section of your code shows that you do not understand loops. That is something you really need to know fully to succeed in the rest of this program and beyond.

- [ ] From your work here, it looks like reviewing some of the material from our statistics courses could help solidify your understanding of some of the concepts underlying much of this project. I know that the idea of pausing your Nanodegree progress for a bit to review other material may sound frustrating or unappealing, but with some time and e ort, you can develop a really strong foundation that will set you up for success throughout the rest of this program.

- [ ] Based on this section of your code, I'd recommend reviewing this lesson [link to lesson]. focusing on the sections about loops. A bit of review can help clarify some of the trickier concepts. Remember that live help mentors are available to chat with you from your classroom as well if you'd like further assistance!

## Mindset in Notes to Students

The personalized note you write to the student is the first thing they'll see when they read your review. That means it's your chance to set the stage for them to benefit as much as possible from your feedback. Encouraging a growth mindset through your note will help the student see any required or suggested changes are helpful learning opportunities rather than signs that they are not cut out for this kind of work. Keep in mind what you learned before about communication best practices in reviews. Using kind, encouraging, honest language will reinforce growth-oriented messages!

Consider the following example of a note that you could write to the student who created the flatbread recipe you saw earlier:

"Your flatbread recipe shows a lot of creativity, and from the picture, it certainly looks delicious! Nonetheless, your work requires changes. The final product is not a sandwich, and you do not give enough information or direction to the cook to make the recipe understandable and replicable. Your instructions are not clear enough for the cook to reliably follow along, and your recipe is also missing crucial elements, like ingredient amounts and several pieces of equipment, that would further confuse the cook. Read on for more details about specific shortcomings."

## Reflect

How might you rewrite the note shown above to better encourage the student to keep iterating on their work and to help them develop a growth mindset? Create at least one new version of a note to the student who produced the flatbread recipe.

### Things to think about

To encourage growth mindset development, your note must make it clear that you believe in the student's ability to keep learning and improving this project (and so should they!). It can be helpful to position the purpose of this review as just providing feedback on how to keep tweaking the recipe and acknowledging that it will meet specifications in the future through some time and effort. Perhaps a note like the following would better communicate a growth mindset:

"Your flatbread recipe shows a lot of creativity, and from the picture, it looks delicious! Your work does require some changes, but with a bit of effort, the recipe will become easier to follow for the cook (and still produce equally tasty results!). Please note first that the project rubric requires your final product to be a sandwich, which unfortunately does not encompass flatbreads. Still, I am sure that with a bit of creative thinking about the definition of a sandwich, you can tweak your idea just a bit to create something that is horizontal, portable, primarily carb-based on the outsides, etc. Please read through the modifications I've suggested, as well as those required by the rubric. A bit of clarification and elaboration in the instructions, equipment, and ingredient areas will take this recipe to the next level, meaning you'll be one step closer to sandwich making mastery!"

# Technical Proficiency

We've discussed best practices for communication and pedagogy in project reviews. The last piece of creating high quality reviews is technical proficiency. Your review must be technically correct in order to be of value to the student. Otherwise we might lead them into a spiral of misconceptions and falsehoods!

What exactly do we mean by technical correctness and proficiency? Great question!

- Your review must not contain information or links to any information that contradict the rubric for the project or any best practices outlined in relevant Udacity course material.
- Your review must take all parts of the rubric into account.
- Your review must not contain technical errors in it.
- Your review must cater to where the student is at in terms of their knowledge and skills. In order for you to make this happen, you need to understand what they know and do not yet know at this point.

Our team here at Udacity will do its best to ensure that you review for projects you are technically prepared for. Still, everyone runs into questions and confusion at some point when reviewing students' submissions. If you are ever wondering about a subject-matter-specific question, reach out to the reviewer community for your Nanodegree program. This is exactly the kind of situation in which you and your fellow reviewers can support one another to lead to better student outcomes. If you feel entirely overwhelmed reviewing a particular submission, you can unassign it from yourself so that someone else can pick it up.

# Synthesizing Communication, Pedagogy, and Technical Proficiency

Each element of your project reviews - rubric comments, in-line comments, and your note to the student - will need to bring together the best practices we've discussed for communication, pedagogy, and technical proficiency. You'll get plenty more practice with this when you submit training submissions for particular projects.

## Project Review Audit Rubric

### Communication

The review is professional: The word choice and tone used in the review is professional and respectful of the student. Comments are formatted appropriately.

The review provides ample qualitative feedback: All rubric criteria that benefit from elaboration have comments explaining their results. There are at least 5 in-line comments within the student's work.

The review is clear and understandable: The review uses correct grammar, information appropriate for the student's skill level, and easy-to-understand language.

The review is both kind and honest: The review provides a balance of positive feedback and opportunities for improvement. It highlights the good elements of the student's work in addition to those that should be changed.

The review is specific to the student at hand: The review is thorough and personalized so that it's relevant and meaningful for the student receiving it.

### Pedagogy

The review encourages a growth mindset: Where appropriate, the reviewer encourages the student to develop a growth mindset. The reviewer never pushes the student to develop a fixed mindset, especially about their ability to learn new things.

The review makes the student an active learner: The review provides the student with guidance in a way that will help them become a stronger problem solver, critical thinker, and independent learner. It facilitates the student's active engagement with the material they're learning, rather than directly providing them with solutions, answers, or other explicit, prescriptive changes to their work.

The review helps the student develop a deep understanding of the content: The review helps the student develop a deep understanding of relevant content. All suggested and/or required changes are accompanied by comments that tie them back to what the student is learning. It's clear that the goal of the review is not just to instruct the student on how to meet the rubric's specifications but rather to help them develop true expertise in the subject matter.

The review reflects the student's current skill level: Comments are appropriate for the skill level of the student and take into account the learning goals of the project.

### Technical Proficiency

The review adheres to the project's rubric: The reviewer only evaluates based on the provided rubric points, and each rubric criteria is thoroughly taken into account.

The review is technically correct: Rubric verdicts (i.e. Requires Changes or Meets Specifications) and comment types (i.e. Awesome, Suggestion, Required) are technically accurate, fair, and in alignment with the project rubric.

The review's in-line comments and rubric evaluation correspond to one another: All required changes (e.g. issues that cause project to be evaluated as Requires Changes) are identified in both rubric and in-line comments.

The review matches the project submitted by the student: The review completed is relevant and correct for the student's project.

## Reflect

Following the best practices you've learned in this course so far will make your reviews powerful learning experiences for Nanodegree students. But some reviewers go the extra mile to make their feedback add an element of delight to the student experience. Put yourself in a student's shoes for a moment - what might make a review seem extra awesome, helpful, or impactful for you?

### Things to think about

There are a million right answers to this question! Here are just a few ideas - keep thinking of more and implementing them in your project reviews! You could...

- Connect the student with resources to help them keep expanding their learning, like online communities, documentation, blog posts, articles, videos. These could be from within Udacity or elsewhere. If the student has demonstrated mastery of the content at hand, give them ideas for how to go beyond the material offered in their Nanodegree program, perhaps through open source projects, challenges or contests, or just introductions to new concepts or tools.

- Create toy examples to help students better understand concepts without handing them answers. Some reviewers do this for programming examples in GitHub Gists.

- Fill your personalized note with growth mindset encouragement! Especially if a student's project requires changes, remind them of how much they're gaining through challenging themselves and iterating on their work.

- Remind them of how to get learning support at Udacity through the mentorship options available for their Nanodegree program. Talk to your reviewer community to learn more about these!
